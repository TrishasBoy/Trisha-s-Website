      <h2>My Everything — Trisha Anne</h2>
      <p>Trisha is my sunshine on rainy days ☀️🌧️, my sleepyhead princess 😴, my shy cutie pie 🥺, and my partner in chaos 🤪. She’s the beautiful soul who stole my heart, once my ate, now my forever love 💘.</p>
      <p>She’s incredibly smart, adorably shy, lovingly clingy, and effortlessly beautiful — even when she doesn't believe it. She’s not into pictures, but her beauty is always on my mind. 💞</p>
      <p>She has the most adorable voice, especially when she talks about her passions. And her selfies? Rare treasures I cherish like gold. 🥹📸</p>
